AWS code samples, architecture diagrams, CloudFormation and SAM templates, Serverless applications, and more.

1. [Amazon CloudFront with on-the-fly Image Resizing](./cloudfront-resize-image/) - Serve images through Amazon CloudFront with support for on-the-fly image resizing.
1. [S3 Cross-Account Replication with KMS](./s3-cross-account-replication-with-kms) - Replicate objects between two S3 buckets in different accounts within the same region using server-side encryption with customer-managed KMS keys.

## Public Gists

1. [Amazon Athena Query](https://gist.github.com/gadavis2/3bb03e724a4dd27c73af731ff9e68e21) - An example Node.js Lambda function that queries Amazon Athena. The example includes using NextToken in a loop to retrieve all of the query results, and the logic to extract the column names and rows from the response.
1. [UUID to Shard Id](https://gist.github.com/gadavis2/faf3d888a3110409b97bc18a59d7c807) - This function will convert a UUID into an integer which can be used for data sharding.
1. [Consistent Hashing Function](https://gist.github.com/gadavis2/d75fcbc40e841ccde5b35cde0ca8858a) - This solution uses a hash function to determine the hash ring position for UUID, IPv4, and IPv6. It is an example of distributed storage/caching using consistent hashing.
