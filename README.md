1. [Amazon CloudFront with on-the-fly Image Resizing](./cloudfront-resize-image/) - Serve images through Amazon CloudFront with support for on-the-fly image resizing.
1. [S3 Cross-Account Replication with KMS](./s3-cross-account-replication-with-kms) - Replicate objects between two S3 buckets in different accounts within the same region using server-side encryption with customer-managed KMS keys.

## Public Gists

1. [Amazon Athena Query](https://gist.github.com/gadavis2/3bb03e724a4dd27c73af731ff9e68e21) - An example Node.js Lambda function that queries Amazon Athena. The example includes using NextToken in a loop to retrieve all of the query results, and the logic to extract the column names and rows from the response.

1. [API Gateway REST API to DynamoDB](https://serverlessland.com/patterns/apigw-dynamodb) - This pattern creates an Amazon API Gateway REST API, with an API key, that integrates directly with an Amazon DynamoDB table.

1. [AWS Lambda Layer and SSM Paramter Store](https://serverlessland.com/patterns/lambda-layer-ssm-parameters) - This AWS SAM application is an example of using a Lambda Layer and the SSM Parameter Store to centrally manage configuration values that can be used by multiple Lambda functions within the same account and region.
