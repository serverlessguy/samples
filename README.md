## About Me

My name is Greg Davis and I am a seasoned Senior Engineering Manager with a proven track record in diverse technical domains. My expertise spans a range of roles, including Software Development Manager, Solutions Architect, Serverless Developer, Database Engineer, Data Integration Architect, Technical Trainer, and Business Development Manager. My passion is to create innovative cloud-native, serverless, event-driven applications; build new high-value solutions to complex problems; lead, coach, and mentor highly technical teams. I have over 8 years of management experience, including 5 years managing managers, and over 15 years of full-stack software development and database engineering experience.

My proficiency extends across a wide spectrum of cloud services, with a particular focus on APIs, serverless compute functions, event workflow orchestration, and content delivery networks. I'm equally adept at leveraging SQL, NoSQL, JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, Infrastructure as Code, and deployment pipelines. I hold several prestigious technical certifications that underscore my expertise including AWS Solutions Architect Professional, AWS DevOps Engineer Professional, Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate SQL Server, and Certified Scrum Master.

Thank you for taking the time to get acquainted with my professional journey!
